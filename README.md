People of Earth, your attention please. This is Prostetnic Vogon of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council.
As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy
require the building of a hyperspatial route through your star system. Regrettably, your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition.
The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth minutes. Thankyou!
There's no point in acting surprised about it.
All planning charts and demolition orders have been on display at your local planning department in Alpha Centauri for 50 of your Earth years, so you've had plenty of 
time to lodge any formal complaint and it's far too late to start making a fuss about it now.....What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? 
Oh for heaven's sake, mankind, it's only 4 light years away.
I'm sorry, but it can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs, that's your own lookout. Engergize the demolition beams.....
